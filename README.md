# The Cauldron
The Cauldron was created for the 2016 Melbourne [Global Game Jam](http://globalgamejam.org/).
The [`melbggj` branch](https://github.com/HarrisonHough/TheCauldrenRepo/tree/melbggj16) is how far we managed to develop in the weekend. The [1master1 branch](https://github.com/HarrisonHough/TheCauldrenRepo/tree/master) will be to show the current release (iOS, Android, Oculus Rift). The [`develop` branch](https://github.com/HarrisonHough/TheCauldrenRepo/tree/develop) is where we have our current development.

## Description
You are a Witch armed with a cauldron facing a swarm of ghosts. Brew up concoctions to fend them off and survive for as long as possible.

Developed for VR, using Oculus Rift and Google Cardboard (for iOS and Android)
