# The Cauldron
The Cauldron was created for the 2016 Melbourne Global Game Jam. 
The melbggj16 branch is how far we managed to develop in the weekend. The master branch will be to show the current release (iOS, Android, Oculus Rift). The develop branch is where we have our current development.

## Description
You are a Witch armed with a cauldron facing a swarm of ghosts. Brew up concoctions to fend them off and survive for as long as possible.
